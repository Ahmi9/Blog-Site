This project is a modern, responsive blog site built using HTML and CSS. It features a clean and minimal design with a focus on readability and user experience. The navigation bar includes a logo and a hamburger menu that appears on smaller screens, allowing users to toggle a side navigation panel that slides in smoothly from the left. The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The main content area displays blog articles with images, headings, descriptions, and interactive "Read More" buttons. A sidebar showcases popular posts with thumbnails and descriptions, as well as a tag section for easy content categorization. The site uses Google Fonts for modern typography and includes subtle box shadows and hover effects for a polished look.

All styles are written in CSS, with media queries providing responsive behavior. The hamburger menu is powered by a simple JavaScript snippet that toggles the navigation panel. The project is easy to customize, making it suitable for personal blogs, portfolios, or as a starting point for more advanced web projects.
